==========================================
Rooftop Energy — Take Home Test (Frontend)
==========================================
A To-do List App frontend built using React + Vite that interfaces with a simple backend API to manage tasks with dependency relationships.

===========
Quick Start
===========
Prerequisites:
- Node.js (16+ recommended)
- npm (or pnpm/yarn)
- Docker & Docker Compose (for running the backend)

Run backend (Docker):
1. cd into the backend folder
2. Ensure a .env exists (there is an example .env in the repo)
3. Start services: (command) docker compose up -d
4. API will be available at http://localhost:8000

Run frontend (dev):
1. cd into /frontend-vite
2. Install dependencies: (command) npm install
3. Start dev server: (command) npm run dev
4. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Build / preview frontend:
- Build: npm run build
- Preview production build: npm run preview

API endpoints used by the frontend (Can be found in /src/Api.tsx):
- GET /tasks
- POST /tasks (request body:  { title: string })
- DELETE /tasks/:id
- POST /tasks/:id/state/:state
- POST /dependencies/:task_id/blockers/:blocker_id

======================================
Task Dependency & Propagation Approach
======================================
Task Model (Can be found in /src/components/types/Task.tsx):
- id: number
- title: string
- state: "BACKLOG" | "TODO" | "IN_PROGRESS" | "DONE"
- blockers: number[]
  - Array of task IDs this task depends on. If any of the tasks in this array is not "DONE", this task will be set to "BACKLOG"
- dependents: number[]
  - Array of task IDs that depend on this task. If this task is not "DONE", the tasks in this array should be in "BACKLOG" state

Propagation logic:
- When a task’s state is changed to a non-BACKLOG state, propogateState(tasks, id, newState):
  - Makes a copy of tasks
  - Applies the state change to the target task
  - Traverses dependents (Depth-First Search):
    - If any blocker of a dependent is not "DONE" → set dependent to "BACKLOG"
    - Else, if dependent's state was "BACKLOG" → set it to "TODO"
  - Uses a visited Set() to avoid re-processing nodes in the traversal
- This keeps downstream tasks blocked automatically when upstream tasks are unfinished.

============================
Data Structures & Algorithms
============================
- Data structure: array of Task objects (simple, flat list).
- Traversal algorithm: Depth-First Search over the dependency array.

========================
Assumptions & Trade-Offs
========================
- Small dataset assumption: arrays + .find() is simpler and adequate for the take-home scope.
- Simplicity over optimality: readable, easy-to-follow code chosen over micro-optimized structures.
- No explicit cycle handling: assumes input graph is acyclic (no circular dependencies). Cycles may cause repeated state toggles or improper propagation.
- UI optimistic updates: current code updates UI only after successful API responses (safer but slower UX), except for local propagation logic which is applied after state-change responses.

======================
Potential improvements
======================
Performance:
- Normalize tasks into a Map<id, Task> for O(1) lookup and O(N + E) propagation.
- Avoid repeated .find() calls inside loops.
- Add memoization/React optimizations: useCallback for handlers and useMemo for columns (avoids frequent table re-inits).
- Virtualize rows for very large task lists.

Robustness:
- Add cycle detection and validation when adding dependencies.
- End-to-end and unit tests for propagation logic & API interactions.

UX & safety:
- Show blocked reason/tooltips on tasks.
- Better error messages and loading states.
